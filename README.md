## Overview

This repository holds code and other relevant files about
**["Are Heterophily-Specific GNNs and Homophily Metrics Really Effective? Evaluation Pitfalls and New Benchmarks"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05755)**, 
which follows the tutorial presented at [**Learning on Graphs 2024**](https://logconference.org/).
For additional details about the tutorial—including information about the speakers, slides, and video—please visit the

## Colab Setup

All the content is designed to work seamlessly with Google Colab. 
Each Jupyter notebook includes installation commands for the necessary libraries at the beginning. 
At the top of each Jupyter notebook, you'll find an icon that lets you open it in Colab with just one click:

In this tutorial, we provide two notebooks:
